# DownloaderTemplate

## About:

A completely credit-free open source template I made in my spare time.
You are free to use the code of it as it is fully open source.
To use it, press the green "Code" button in the top right, press "Download ZIP" and go to your files, press "Extract All" and then open the .csproj.
I do not know what this is going to be used for, but I designed it to be a template for beginner coders trying to get into using System in C#.
Hopefully it won't be used for bad purposed, like downloading malware or something like that.
Also, you can check it for RAT's (Remote Access Trojan's) as it is fully open source.
